LastChristMas i gave you my heart
But the very next day you gave it away
This year to save me form tear
I give it to someone special

Once bitten and twice shy
I keep my distance
but you still catch my eye
tell me baby
"Do you recognize ?"
Well
It's been a year,
It doesn't surprise me
--Merry ChristMas--

LastChristMas i gave you my heart
But the very next day you gave it away
This year to save me form tear
I give it to someone special
