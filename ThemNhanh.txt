LastChristMas i gave you my heart
But the very next day you gave it away
This year to save me form tear
I give it to someone special

Once bitten and twice shy
I keep my distance
but you still catch my eye



LastChristMas i gave you my heart
But the very next day you gave it away
This year to save me form tear
I give it to someone special
